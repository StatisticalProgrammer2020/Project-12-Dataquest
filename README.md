# DQ R-Project 12: Building a Spam Filter
This is my twelveth project in Dataquest towards my journey in R Programming. This project aims to build an algorithm that would filter out spam from SMS messages. Specifically we'll be using the Naive Bayes algorithm from a previously classified dataset to predict the probability of classification and actually classifying an SMS message whether it's spam or not. In this project, the following concepts are used to achieve the given problem:
- Conditional Probability
- Bayes Theorem
- Naive Bayes Algorithm

# Data source

The source of the dataset can be accessed here: https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/475/spam.csv

This dataset contains 1,000 rows and 2 columns.

# Variables

Here are the following variables that were used in the analysis:
- Label - classification of the text message (whether spam or not spam/ham)
- SMS - text message
